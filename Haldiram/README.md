## 📌 Introduction  
This repository presents a **case study on Haldiram**, one of India’s leading packaged food and snack brands. Since real company datasets of FMCG giants like Haldiram are **not publicly available**, I adopted a **unique approach** by scraping **YouTube comments** from Haldiram-related videos. These comments were then analyzed to extract insights into consumer perception, brand value, and overall sentiment.  

By combining business case study methodology with data-driven insights from user-generated content, this project bridges the gap between **traditional case studies** and **modern data analysis**.

- **Innovation in Product Line** (health-conscious snacks, international flavors).  
- **Digital Expansion** (leveraging e-commerce, delivery platforms).  
- **Localized Global Strategy** for overseas markets.
